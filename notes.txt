1.  When traps (Arcane trap for example) are set in a dungeon, then you change to another dungeon the dungeon monsters
from which you change from are fully healed on purpose. This is because when you exit a dungeon that dungeon's
monsters with heal fully in general. However the trap will stil ldo DOT to the monsters even when you are in other
dungeons and change dungeon from other dungeons.
